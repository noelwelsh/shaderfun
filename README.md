# OpenGL Fragment Shaders in Scala

An example of an OpenGL fragment shader in Scala using the LWJGL OpenGL bindings. The most useful part of this code it demonstrates the setup required to get OpenGL working with the sparsely documented LWJGL 3.0.0 and sbt. The code itself is an ugly translation of Java code with too much mutable state. The shader is very boring. But it works!

## To Run

You should be able to `sbt compile` and `sbt run` and will all work.
